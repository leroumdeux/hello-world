# What's this?
Hi everyone!

This is just another `hello-world` repository made with GitHub's guide. Maybe I should introduce myself?

## Who is @leroumdeux?

I'm a 17-years-old high school student curious about lots of stuff such as languages, geopolitics, journalism and tech.

You could check out my very *interesting* [website](https://alexandru.fr).

> It's just a Wordpress website, I know: **very lame**! And it's in ~~baguette language~~ French...

## What are my coding projects?

As for today (August 1st, 2021):

* learn to use GitHub
* get back into coding
* have fun!

## Where can I find you?

To be honest, [Twitter @leroumdeux](https://twitter.com/leroumdeux). That's my favourite social media, so it makes senseã€€ðŸ˜‰
